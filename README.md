# About my profile

## General 

Hello, my name is Misha Zaslavskis! I am an Electronics and Computer Engineering student at the University of Kent.

I am developing electronic devices with compact size and medical and programming for the hardware section. I started studying electronics when I was children.

My favourite fields of electronics are embedded systems and circuits and printed circuit board designing, specialising in electronics components suitable for design specifications and programming. 

Working on drone projects, such as PiElectricsEagles and ElectricsEagle. Repository: https://github.com/Electrics-Eagles

I am currently studying at the University of Kent with 3rd stage. 

I want to become fully qualified in engineering at technology-intensive companies.

## Skills

During my computer journey, I have written programs in C, C++, C# and Python programming languages.

I am able to solder circuits and handle electronic equipment well, even QFN integrated circuits and SMD components with size 0402. 

For my next project, I am studying VDHL, API programming Raspberry PI Pico or RP2040 chip microcontrollers, and designing electronics circuits that meet international standards and require specification and reliability. Moreover, I am learning about different kinds of memories for low-power embedded devices.

I am designing electronics circuits and PCBs via DipTrace and Autodesk Eagle (for university). However, I currently use KiCAD software (my projects have been published). 

I have a driver's license B category.

## Favorites (things and hardwares) and having tools

My favourite series of microcontrollers are RP2040, RA4M1, stm32F4, stm32L4, stm32F0, atmega328P.

My favourite operating systems are Linux Mint 19.3 Tricia and Debian 11 "bullseye". 

Microcontroller debugger/programmer: ST-LINK/V2 debug USB AVRISP XPII programmer, Raspberry Pi Debug Probe. 

I have evaluation development tools: Arduino UNO R3/4, Arduino Mega, NUCLEO-F030R8, NUCLEO-F439ZI, Raspberry Pi 1/4/5 Model B, Atmega328p xplained mini, Raspberry Pi Pico, Raspberry PI Pico W and own RP2040 MCU development board (later will fully release).
