### Hello, my name is Misha ###

Website: https://misha-dig.github.io/

I am a graduate engineering student with a passion for electronics engineering since childhood and an interest in developing medical and embedded devices. I love designing custom hardware-embedded device PCBs. 

I am looking for roles in Junior Electronics Engineering, PCB design, firmware and software development.   

### Skills ###
* ***Electronic & PCB Design*** - Developing electronic hardware from concepts to turn into products by designing custom PCBs. I am currently working with ***KiCAD*** or ***Altium***, but I previously used ***Autodesk Eagle***, ***EasyEDA***, and ***DipTrace***. I am able to generate the right manufacturing files after finishing designing the PCB. 
* ***Microcontroller*** - Proficient experience working and debugging with ***STM32, RP2040, RP2350 and AVR-family*** microcontrollers. Using an API and a HAL vendor-manufactured microcontroller to develop embedded firmware. Also used bare-metal and regsiter-level programming.
* ***Firmware & Software development*** - Experience in developing firmware and lightweight software with multiple programming languages ***C, C++, Rust, Python, and C#***. 
* ***Assembly PCB*** - Experience with soldering SMD electronics components, I am able to solder ***QFN integrated circuit chips*** and down up to ***0402 size SMD components*** without any problems and helping. 
* ***Designing & printing 3D mechanical parts*** - Designing enclosed electronics devices by using ***Autodesk Fusion 360***.

### Currently and Future learning ###
* *Machine Learning with Python programming language*
* *RP2040 RP2350 Register-level programming*
* *RS232 RS422 RS485 Protocols*
* *Verilog HDL FPGA*
* *Designing Large Scale Microcontroller PCB*

### Other and Interpersonal Skills ###
* ***Ablity to work with teamwork*** - I can adapt to both team and individual work environments. I can make efficient communication between teams in the workplace. 
* ***Written Documentation*** - I can write documentation and draft specifications for prototyping electronics products. 
* ***Driving B Category Vechicle*** - I can drive vehicles with more than two years of experience.
