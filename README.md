My favorite UART chips are FT232, CP2101. 
My favorite semiconductors are LM358, IRFZ34, 2N7000. 

I have microcontroller debugger/programmer: ST-LINK/V2 debug, USB AVRISP XPII programmer. 
I have evaluation development tools: Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega, NUCLEO-F030R8, NUCLEO-F439ZI, Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+ .

I design electronics and PCB via DipTrace, EasyEda (Online editor) and Autodesk Eagle (for university). 

My favorite operation system is Linux Mint 19.3 Tricia and Debian 11 "bullseye".
